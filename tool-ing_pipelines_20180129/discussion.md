## Make

I was amazed about using [Make](bsmith89.github.io/make-bml/) for running pipelines and I found this:

## Nextflow

Example of [nextflow](https://github.com/nextflow-io/examples)

## bpipes

[bpipe](https://github.com/Oshlack/bpipe-pipelines) is very good to start with pipelines, is a little better than bash scripts

## Sevenbridge

(SevenBridge example)[https://igor.sbgenomics.com/public/apps/?__hstc=64521200.3f6c18a48e5d7ee99d319d0096e54d5b.1517344954922.1517344954922.1517344954922.1&__hssc=64521200.4.1517344954922&__hsfp=1796870082#admin/sbg-public-data/alignment-metrics-qc/?__hstc=64521200.3f6c18a48e5d7ee99d319d0096e54d5b.1517344954922.1517344954922.1517344954922.1&__hssc=64521200.4.1517344954922&__hsfp=1796870082]

And the actual file that [configure the pipeline](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/raw/admin/sbg-public-data/alignment-metrics-qc/3).

## CWL

The format many of them are accepting as an universal one: [CWL](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language
)

Here is the stupidest of the [examples](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/workflows/tree/master/workflows/hello).

And the actual [format](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/workflows/blob/master/workflows/hello/hello-param.cwl) of the pipeline:
